This tutorial demonstrates the Routing Information Protocol, and its implementation in INET.
TODO: briefly about RIP (should be elaborated on how RIP works in one of the steps, step1 or step2)

This is an advanced tutorial, and it assumes that you are familiar with creating
and running simulations in OMNeT++ and INET. If you aren't, you can check out
the <a href="https://docs.omnetpp.org/tutorials/tictoc/"
target="_blank">TicToc Tutorial</a> to get started with using OMNeT++.

If you need more information at any time, feel free to refer to the OMNeT++ and
INET documentation:
